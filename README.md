## Description

The aim of this project is to deploy a time series model.From training, my model of choice is the XGBoost Model

Accurate sales forecasting is essential for maximising inventory, resource allocation, and decision-making processes in the dynamic world of retail. In this project, we delve into the realm of time series forecasting for store sales, aiming to provide a robust predictive model for Favorita, a leading Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.
